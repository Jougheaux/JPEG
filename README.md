## Features

- 185fps average, 220 max, standard deviation of as low as 10fps (should increase with better wheels)
- Brushless
- BCAR
- Selectfire
- Pre-wheel bearing guide
- Runs on KellyIndustries Dettlaff and Plusmotors

## Instructions
If you want to build this buy the hardware, look at the CAD, follow Dettlaff instructions (which are all in the folder with pre-configured firmware)

## Hardware List
Kellytime (Detlaff, Plusmotor)  
Parts cost about $170 per part, total cost higher if buying sets of screws

Note: the worker stock is optional, however it is designed to only fit that stock.

## Thank Yous
I was the one working on the CAD, but this couldn't have been done without the efforts of the "RPI Nerf Industrial Complex" and members of the nerf community.
- Adrian Kelly/ KellyIndustries supplied their new [plus motors](https://kellyindustries.us/collections/flywheel-parts/products/plus-motor-brushless) and [Dettlaff](https://kellyindustries.us/collections/flywheel-parts/products/dettlaff-brushless-blaster-controller) along with creating the bruxa, which JPEG's pusher is based on (and the [Kellyindustries discord](https://discord.gg/gnhjt6QDAX) for helping troubleshoot)
- [Raymond Chien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-chien-1a0341229?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) for giving me parts and designs to work off of and for being a meme lord
- [Brad](https://thefactoryamsterdam.com/) [Roboman](https://roboman.net/) for giving me  bearings and being a cool dude
- [Gavinfuzzy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GavinfuzzyCustoms) for giving me CAD for the worker stock from the SBL
- Mike Farley and Mathew Davis for helping guide aesthetics and design langauge
- RPI HVZ community for providing feedback and help
- Most importantly, Sofia Sherman for keeping me sane and grounded while I do CAD for way too many hours

## To Do
- Print, assembly, wiring guides
- Code tweaks to be more consistent
- Solenoid version (pusher body can be repurposed to have a solenoid mount I just need to do CAD) (Eli Wu if you're reading this can I have one please)
- See if sls cage is better
